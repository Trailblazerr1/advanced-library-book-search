Search books in library according to genre
    
It took me hours to search book of my favourite genre from IIITA's library.    
(Library site is hell boring)
Irritated, I made this script to find books according to genre.
Now, finding books ain't that bad. :)    

P.S.: This script works only from IIITA's proxy
